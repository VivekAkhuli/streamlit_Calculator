python is very simple and easy to learn bcoz python uses english like statement.
python is platform independent.
python is a interpreted technology hence suitable for web platform.
python is a highly extensible laguage bcoz it supports batteries(plug-ins and play other libraries).
integer cache - python can store same id value in between (-5 to 256).
python stores the latest variable in "_". so that we can add a 1 value to the new valiable without using the variable.but we can only use it only one time in a program. 


how a python program runs?

* shell mode or console mode - its simply process the interpretation....it does not go for compilation mode.

* in python programming it is processing the compilation 1st then it interprets the 2nd.

token = it is the smallest individual unit or element in the python understood by compiler. types of tokens:
>reserved words
>identifiers
>literals
>delimeters
>operators

* list is a collection of items in a particular order..like any range of numbers, family members name, shopping cart user choice, a group of ip addresses to be traced etc.
* list is mutable data structure.
 ex.: 1=[1,2,3,4]
	>>> id(l1)
	2359738340800
	>>> l1[0]
	1
	>>> l1[0]=100
	>>> l1
	[100, 2, 3, 4]
	>>> id(l1)
	2359738340800

*** ACCESSING ELEMENTS IN THE LIST**
*appending - it is the adding element at the end of the list.
* insert - it insert at a particular index.
* pop - pop method uses LIFO algo.
* del - to delete all the list at a time we use del
* remove - it is used by the name of the element to delete or remove an element.

***ORGANIZING THE LIST ***
* sort is used for permanenet sorting and sorted method is used for a single time to sort a list but not sort the list permanently.
* reverse - it is used to reversed the list permanently
* range - it is used for a collection of numbers.
* numerical list = range() function.
